## About Me
I am a PhD student at the [Web Information Systems (WIS) Group](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) of the [Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS/EWI)](http://www.ewi.tudelft.nl/), Delft University of Technology. 

Currently, I mainly focus on understanding MOOC leaners' behaviors based on data anaytics. Specifically, I am interested in acquiring knowledge about the dynamics of MOOC learners' behaviors based on sequencial data analysis.

My promoter is [Prof. dr. ir. Geert-Jan Houben](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/houben/) and my daily supervisor is [Dr. Claudia Hauff](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/hauff/).
